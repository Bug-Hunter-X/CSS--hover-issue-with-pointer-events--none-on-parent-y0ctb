The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class is not observed for the child element when the parent element has a `pointer-events: none;` property applied to it.

```css
.parent {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  pointer-events: none; /* This prevents hover effects on the parent */
}

.child {
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.parent:hover .child {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This hover effect is not triggered */
}
```

The intended behavior is that when the mouse hovers over the `.parent` element, the `.child` element's background color should change to light green. However, due to the `pointer-events: none;` on the parent, the hover state is not propagated to the child element.
